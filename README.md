Turbo Pascal assemply: tool to switch between LCD and VGA output on old laptops

Thies two programms switching between the LCD and VGA output. It works on laptops with the Cirrus Logic GD610/620 graphic chipset like the FMA8100 model.

There are tow files, so it' easyer to switch between the output if you dont see anything on the screen. So you need only stelect the right file with up or down and press enter. You dont need to write long commands with commandline options when you are blind.

ToDO: If we find out in whitch output mode the graphic chip currently is, so we can write a program which simply switches between modes and we need only one file.
