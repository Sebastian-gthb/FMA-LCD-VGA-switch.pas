Turbo Pascal assemply: tool to switch between LCD and VGA output on old laptops

Thies two programms switching between the LCD and VGA output. It works on laptops with the Cirrus Logic GD610/620 graphic chipset like the FMA8100 model.

There are tow files, so you can select the right output. You dont need to write long commands with commandline options when you are blind.

There is a new file vout-sw.pas (video output switch) they read the current output display (LCD or CRT) and switch to the other output. Thats more easyer to use.
